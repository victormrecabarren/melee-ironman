This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## A work in progress
## Once complete, user will be able to :
- Sign up for an account 
- Randomize a new 2 player iron-man match
- Revert to original "snake vs reverse-snake" order
- Option to randomize all ditto matches
- Keep track live of stocks taken and stocks lost
- Save matches
- Get data about matches (Which character was each player's strongest? Which player had the longest streak? etc.)
- Get data about the user (Which character does this user perform the best with? Which character does this user perform the worst against? etc.)
